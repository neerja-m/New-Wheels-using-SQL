## Business Context and Problem Statement: 
New-Wheels, a vehicle resale company, has launched an app with an end-to-end service from listing the vehicle on the platform to shipping it to the customer's location. This app also captures the overall after-sales feedback given by the customer. 

## Problem Statement
New-Wheels sales have been dipping steadily in the past year, and due to the critical customer feedback and ratings online, there has been a drop in new customers every quarter, which is concerning to the business. The CEO of the company now wants a quarterly report with all the key metrics sent to him so he can assess the health of the business and make the necessary decisions. An array of questions  are being asked at the leadership level that needs to be answered using data. Import the dump file that contains various tables that are present in the database. Use the data to answer the questions posed and create a quarterly business report for the CEO.

## Data Description
You have data on the vehicles you sell: what is the make, model, and year? What is the price point? Data on your customers, such as where they live and payment methods, data on orders and shipments, such as when the order was shipped and received, what the after-sales feedback was, and so on.

## Solution Approach
Used SQL to answer the key quesitons posed by the leadership team, and to plot some visuals analyzing the results in Excel. Create a presentation summarizing these results.

## SQL 
The SQL Queries.txt file contains the queries that were used in this project. This included use of common table expressions, window functions, aggregations to calculate various metrics like quarter over quarter % change in revenue, discount trends, trend of revenues and  orders over the quarters
